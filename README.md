This project is a mix between a blog and a shop page.  
It’s set up as an anime blog where posts talk about shows, characters, and themes, but the real purpose is to advertise an anime shop.  

The blog highlights products (like figures, manga, and merch) while keeping the format casual and easy to read.  
It’s more of a showcase project than a full-scale site, but the idea is to get readers interested in the shop through the blog.  
It's an engaging page to bring in people of interest to the shop and get more sales in.

Simple, straightforward
